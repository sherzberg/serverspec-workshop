This website is/has been used for a `Serverspec` workshop.

Conventions
-----------

Throughout the workshop, there will be blocks where you type as file contents
and others where you type in a shell prompt.

File contents looks like:

```text
This is
some
file contents
```

Things you should execute should start with `$` prompts:

```bash
$ docker ps
$ date
```

The `$` is a subtle difference, but should be enough to distinguish.
